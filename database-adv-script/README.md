### SQL Joins

1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves bookings along with the user who made the booking.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all properties and their reviews; includes properties without any reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOINs to include all users and all bookings, even those without matches.

### Subqueries
1. **Non-correlated**: Filters properties based on average review rating.
2. **Correlated**: Filters users by dynamically counting their bookings.
